can you add error messages as i have added - the null checks
if (!headerDescription) throwElementNullError('#headerDescription');

also, for some reason, the eslint is not working, can you to eslint checks

also, can you add json structure type validation like
if (!data?.Project_Section?.Title) {
  console.error('Invalid data structure: missing Project_Section.Title');
  return;
}

can you add data validation like

const validateProjectData = (project) => {
    const required = ['Title', 'OnelineDescription'];
    return required.every(field => project?.[field]);
}; 

but isn't it redundant as json structure type validation - maybe not needed if json structure type validation is there

about u said - 

createSectionRenderer - the reason i did not do this because, my different sections have different children and tags in them, so, a generic renderer would be problematic i thought
